# Project Description

This project began as a small team initiative to participate in the HHS Opioid Code-a-Thon schedule from Dec. 6, 2017 through Dec. 7, 2017.
Our team's original intent was to meet other Data Science teams in the local area, learn more about the intersection between Data Science and health care, and, most importantly, to help fight the Opioid epidemic sweeping through our country.

Through hard work and determination, our team was awarded first place in the "Prevention Track".  Since then, we have continued development on our solution [("Take Back America")](http://takeback.labs.visionistinc.com/)

The code contained in this repository is used in the acquisition of zip codes, county level information, and dropbox locations.  All of these pieces of information are used to help us display relevant information to users through the [("Take Back America")](http://takeback.labs.visionistinc.com/) front end.
